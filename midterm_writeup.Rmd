# Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset that I am going to be making inferences on contains information on 
NCAA softball games during the 2022 and 2023 seasons. I am planning on using the 
2022 season as the training data set and make inferences on the 2023 games. I am
going to create a simple logistic regression model that uses a simple ranking 
system (RPI) and make conclusions on the predicted outcome of a given game.
